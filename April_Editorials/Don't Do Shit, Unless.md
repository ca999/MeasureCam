# Solution

* Sort the array and find the sum of the first $m$ elements of the array. If the sum turns out to be even. Then we have already found our answer.

- If the sum happens to be odd, to make it even and keep it $minimum$, we have to:-
 * either remove the $largest odd number from the first$ $m$ elements 
of the array and then add the $smallest even number$ occurring after the first $m$ elements.        
 * remove the $largest even number$ from the first $m$ elements and 
then add the $smallest odd number$ occurring after the first $m$ 
elements.

   Choose one among the above such that the sum is $minimal$.

* If none of the above condition exists then, we can never make the sum even, so print $-1$.

* Otherwise we have found the $minimim$ sum!
